# Template for slides in TH Köln style

This repository contains a template for slides made in LaTeX Beamer.

I have created this template during my work for the TH Köln -- University of Applied Sciences.
The template makes use of the official corporate identity colors of TH Köln and tries to mimic the official PowerPoint template.
